    Thirty years after its original publication, <em>The Stranger</em> remains among the most influential books of our time. A terrifying picture of a man victimized by life itself—he is a faceless man, who has committed a pointless murder—it is a book whose unrelenting grip upon our consciousness has not diminished to this day.

    The sun is a constant motif in this story. The sun is present at the funeral of Mersault's mother, again on the beach before the pivotal moment of the first half, and yet again in the courtroom. The sun follows Mersault, seemingly taunting him and beating down on him relentlessly. Jaded by the absurdity of life, Mersault lets the sun dictate his actions depending on the severity of its aggression upon him. The sun leads him to joyous moments in life, but also sinister ones.
