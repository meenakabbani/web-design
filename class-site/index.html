    <p>
    On the first day of class, I was taken aback by the work I was able to create. It was a simple segment of code but to me, it felt like magic. I didn't think I would ever be able to create a website, let alone one that had interactive features (the features being a hover effect and an href link). Now that I’m nearing the end of this class, I am so proud of the work I’ve done and the new skills and features I’ve learned to code. I’ve talked a lot this semester about the beauty and extension of the creator a website offers, and I have truly meant it. 
    <br>
    <br>
    I have felt like every website I’ve been able to create has been an extension of me, especially project 3 and my baking website. Before, I was confined to Adobe Suite products, plugging away at whatever Illustrator file I was working on, but now, I’m able to take the work from those apps and put them onto a bigger, more engaging platform as a website. I finally have the tools and capabilities to code my own personal website and compile all my work into one cohesive, cool-looking site that doesn't rely on Squarespace templates. I’ve really enjoyed my time in this class and everything I’ve been able to learn and there’s no telling what else I’ll be able to create now with these skills!
